    "explanation": "The correct answer is D because the verb “are” should agree with the subject “neither of the boys”, which is singular. Therefore, the correct sentence should be “Neither of the boys in my math class who are in the chess club is interested in participating in the tournament.” The word “neither” is used to mean “not one and not the other of two people or things” and is always singular, so it should be followed by a singular verb. In this case, the verb “is” should be used instead of “are”.",
