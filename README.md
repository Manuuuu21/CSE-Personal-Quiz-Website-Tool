# CSE-Personal-Quiz-Website-Tool

I wanted to share with you all the CS Exam/Quiz Website tool that I've built. I design this website tool application for offline use, so you can easily review it using your mobile, laptop or desktop. 

Here, you can take an exam consisting of 150 questions. As for the quiz, you can configure it manually. You can also view the report of rating and reviewed your answer in quiz or exam, and track your score as shown in the pictures.

The best feature here is that you can create your own questions, which you can also share with us for us to answer and I hope it for that to happen. I have created a questionnaire format file that you can access in folder.

My goal is to to make your study sessions interactive, modern, and engaging (Game-based learning approach). Also, this tool offers an interactive, modern, and captivating way for you to review, prepare for the CS Exam. I believe that effective learning should be dynamic and enjoyable, and I hope this tool helps you achieve your goals.

Try it out and provide feedback. :)
