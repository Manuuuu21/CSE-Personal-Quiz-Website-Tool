    "explanation": "The statement “Sarah is likely a chef. She can chop vegetables really fast.” does make some assumptions. Here’s how it aligns to the question:<br/><br/><b>Speed in chopping vegetables helps chefs prepare meals faster.</b> - This assumption is implied in the statement. If Sarah’s fast vegetable chopping is being used as evidence of her being a chef, it suggests that this skill is beneficial in a culinary profession.<br/><br/><b>Only people who can chop vegetables fast can be chefs.</b> - This assumption is not necessarily made in the statement. While it suggests that fast vegetable chopping is a characteristic of a chef (which Sarah possesses), it doesn’t claim that it’s a requirement or that only individuals with this skill can be chefs.<br/><br/><b>Chopping vegetables fast helps Sarah cook.</b> - This assumption seems to be implied. If Sarah’s fast chopping is being linked to her being a chef, it suggests that this skill aids in her cooking.<br/><br/><b>Chefs can usually chop vegetables fast.</b> - This assumption is made in the statement. It’s suggested that fast vegetable chopping is a typical skill of a chef.<br/><br/><b>Fast chopping enables chefs to handle more orders.</b> - This assumption is not explicitly made in the statement. While it could be inferred, the statement doesn’t directly link fast chopping to the ability to handle more orders.",
